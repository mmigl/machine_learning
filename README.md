# A Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Success in Pediatric Patients
The objective of this study was to use the dataset in which pediatric patients with blood-related diseases undergoing donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed over many variables, to train different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict which features are the most important in predicting a patientâ€™s transplant success defined by their survival status. 
The dataset consisted of binary, categorical, and integer values with variables looking at the recipient, the donor, and the specific factors for each procedure. 
Random Forest, LDA, and logistic regression were devised for the supervised methods to test which was best-predicting model.
